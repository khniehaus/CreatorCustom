# README #

This repository contains the buildscript and dependencies for building CreatorCustom for the Apple MAC OS X operating system.
CreatorCustom is a derivative of MakeHuman software, created as a prototype as part of a PhD research project. 
CreatorCustom and the relevant research are projects of Kiona Hagen Niehaus (https://www.kh-niehaus.com)

Please note: Because of recent changes in OS X's support for OpenGL, I cannot guarantee the correct function of this code on opperating systems after MacOS Mojave. 

### Instructions ###

To launch software, run MakeHuman.py file in makehuman_hg directory. 
Requires Python 2.7 and Pillow library (though can be run without the latter). 

Note: To export your creation successfully, go to ‘Geometries’ and select ‘Adult genitals’, then export. To continue modeling, go back to ‘Geometries’ and select ‘None’.
